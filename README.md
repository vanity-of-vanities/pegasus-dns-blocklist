# pegasus-dns-blocklist
Block all known domains/IP's related to NSO's Pegasus spyware

If you think you may have been infected with Pegasus, you can use this list to block all known domains associated with it. But, be warned, by using this list, many sites and apps may stop working correctly due to blocking certain widely used domains such as amazon AWS.

This list is a work in progress and will be updated as more domains are discovered.

The list is in Adblock syntax only for the moment and will work with most apps such as Little Snitch, Brave, and other apps that allow for lists in Adblock syntax.
